### Previous requirements 
* [Terraform Cli](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)
* [AWS Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
* AWS account and [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) 

To use IAM credentials to authenticate the Terraform AWS provider, the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variable must be set.

**$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws_key_id>**

Secret key.

**$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws_secret>**

The terraform {} block contains the Terraform configuration, including any necessary providers that Terraform will use to provide the infrastructure.

## Desplegar instancias ec2 

The resource block is used to define the components of your infrastructure. In this case we will define the ec2 instances.

Once our architecture is defined.

**$terraform init**

Once our architecture is defined.

**$terraform fmt**

To format our code.

**$terraform apply**

To deploy our architecture
